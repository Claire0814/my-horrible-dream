			<font size= "5" style="text-align:front" face="times new roman' color="#E6B0AA" > ~ Where am I ? ~ I asked myself, what replies me is silence. There is a wasteland right in front of my eyes, which located next to the sea. The entire abandoned amusement park is full of dust, damaged building, and tattered facility.<br> I have finally realized that I entered into another world that does not belong to me.</br><br> I quickly run away from the abandoned amusement park to the beach. On my halfway of thinking what should I do to get out of this weird place, suddenly, there is a sound behind my back. As I am about to turn around, I felt two people grab my arms, try to drag me into the building.  </br>

As I look around, I realize that I am standing right in the middle of the gym with a bunch of people who ware the same shirt as me. <br> ~ What is happening now?~ I ask the girl who stands next to me.</br><br>She looked at me with a frightened face and replied: ~We are now forced to play a horror game by those crazy people!!! ~ </br>
